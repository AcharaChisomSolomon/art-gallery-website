## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Really tested my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also learned how to use the Leaflet JS library to create an interactive map.


### Continued development

I would like to continue working on my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills. I would also like to learn more about the Leaflet JS library and how to use it to create more interactive maps.


### Useful resources
